## FlexBox Playground

### Practice FlexBox patterns in real time

Written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript using VSCode

---

Web Page where students of FlexBox can explicitly set different properties of the FlexBox rule system, and view the results in real time.

### Introduction

Flexbox is powerful, but not immediately intuitive.   Practice makes perfect, but practicing on an in-progress web site/application can break existing layouts causing delays and frustrations.   There are many tools for utilizing Flexbox, but this one is simply offered for a student level instructional tool.   The code is Open Source, so you can dig into the details of implementation, seeing how Flexbox works behind the scenes.   

A primitive layout of 4 boxes, with customizable content, is provided where you can, risk free, test how to distribute and align these items using Flexbox with simple on-screen user controls

### Features include...

1. Both Horizontal and Vertically oriented Flexbox Containers with 4 
children (ie flex-items) which can individually be customized with different text.

2. Layout of the Playground elements is done without Flexbox so the student can see some comparisons.

### Downsides...

1.  No attempt was made to create a Mobile-First layout.   Indeed, this is not the intent.   The layout is more suited for a wide screen/desktop/laptop where all the controls can be visible at once.   However, the Horizontal and Vertical views of your Flex Items will simulate the respective Portrait and Landscape orientations of smaller viewport mobile devices, just for prototyping purposes only.
